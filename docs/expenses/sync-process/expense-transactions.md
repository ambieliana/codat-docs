## Overview

An expense is a transaction that represents the purchase made by your customer and the context behind that purchase. It usually includes the following details:

- Transaction type, e.g. whether it's a payment or a refund
- General ledger account the transaction should be reconciled to
- Associated tax rates
- Applicable tracking categories

With Sync for Expenses, you need to create the expense transactions first and push that dataset to Codat. We will describe options available to you on this page. 

Then, you need to [sync expenses](/expenses/sync-process/syncing-expenses) to reflect these in your customer's accounting platform. Finally, once these transactions have been synced, you can [upload attachments](/expenses/sync-process/uploading-receipts) to associate receipts with the transaction.

This process is summarized on the diagram below.

``` mermaid

## Create expenses

To create a new expense transaction in Codat, use the [Create expense transaction](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/create-expense-transaction) endpoint. 

In the request, make sure that the transaction's `id` is unique as it serves as an idempotence key. Codat validates the `id` to ensure that it's unique to a company, preventing the creation of duplicate transactions in your SMB's accounting software. 

Next, you need to follow up with an expense sync to reflect this item of spend in the customer's accounting platform. We cover this in detail in [Sync expenses](/expenses/sync-process/syncing-expenses).

### Draft transactions

:::info Compatible integrations

Check our [API reference](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/create-expense-transaction) for an up-to-date list of integrations that support this functionality.

:::

Some accounting platforms allow expense transactions to be created in a draft state. This means the user can review the expense in the software before finalizing and posting it prior to reconciliation. 

In the request body, use the `postAsDraft` flag to define whether the expense should be posted in its draft or final state. When set to `true`, the expense is posted as a draft. 

### Multicurrency expense transactions

Sync for Expenses validates each expense transaction involving foreign currency. We ensure that the combination of participating currencies will be accepted by the target accounting platform as a valid expense. You can read more about [expenses in foreign currency](/expenses/fx-management) and platform support for different transaction types.
 
### Default tax rates

If you need to remove an associated tax rate from an expense, use one of the following default values that have no impact on the expense:

| Platform          | Default tax rate                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| QuickBooks Online | `NON`                            |
| Xero              | `NONE`                           |
| Oracle NetSuite   | `-7`                             |
| Dynamics 365      | Set up and apply a `0%` tax rate | 
| QuickBooks Desktop| Null                             | 

### Transaction types

Sync for Expenses maps and processes expense transactions based on the following transaction types:

| Transaction type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `reward`         | Represents reward redemptions, such as cashback.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `transferIn`     | A transfer that decreases the   balance of the credit card account or increases the balance of a bank   account. <br/>  Represents a   top-up of debit card account, a pay-down of a credit card account, or a   balance transfer to another credit card. |

## Update expenses

:::info Compatible integrations

Check our [API reference](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/update-expense-transaction) for an up-to-date list of integrations that support this functionality.

:::

In some cases, your customer may want to update an expense transaction that was previously synced to their accounting platform. Use our [Update expense transactions](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/update-expense-transaction) endpoint to edit the following parameters and reflect the change in the SMB's accounting software: 

- Net expense amount 
- Tax amount of the spend
- Tax rate reference associated with the spend
- Expense bank account reference
- Tracking category objects
- Description and notes

```http title="Update an expense transaction"
PUT  https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/sync/expenses/expense-transactions
```

## Create transfer

Transfers are used to record the movement of money between two bank accounts. They are used to represent transactions such as top-ups of debit card accounts, pay-downs of a credit card account, or a balance transfer to another credit card. 

To create a new transfer transaction in Codat, use the [Create transfer transaction](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/create-transfer-transaction) endpoint. 

In the request URL, make sure that the transaction's `id` is unique as it serves as an idempotence key. Codat validates the `id` to ensure that it's unique to a company, preventing the creation of duplicate transactions in your SMB's accounting software. 

Next, you need to follow up with an expense sync to reflect this item of spend in the customer's accounting platform. We cover this in detail in [Sync expenses](/expenses/sync-process/syncing-expenses).

```json title="Transfer transaction request body"
{
  "Description": "Sample transfer description",
  "Date": "2024-02-14T00:00:00Z",
  "From": {
    "AccountRef": {
      "Id": "a6980b6f-29dc-4c28-9596-f6c75e29f3b6"
    },
    "Amount": 1000.00
  },
  "To": {
    "AccountRef": {
      "Id": "a352b2f9-d47c-46ee-9561-731c6acff930"
    },
    "Amount": 1000.00
  }
}
```

Note that the currencyRate of the transfer transaction is inferred from the 'from amount' and 'to amount'.

### Multicurrency transfer transactions

Sync for Expenses validates each transfer transaction involving foreign currency. We ensure that the combination of participating currencies will be accepted by the target accounting platform as a valid expense. You can read more about [transfers in foreign currency](/expenses/fx-management#transfers) and platform support for different expense type.
