Connecting is just the beginning of the customer journey. If your use case requires a persistent connection, then it is necessary to allow your customers to manage their ongoing connections. Your customers should feel, and be in control.

:::tip
Why this matters

Your customers need visibility and control over the connections they own. Without the ability to view and update connections, your customers may feel a lack of control and lose trust. This may not directly affect the likelihood of your customers connecting but may affect trust between you and your customer.

## Allow users to view their live connections

In the connection management view, consider showing your customers some or all of the following:

- Name of the connected platform
- First sync time and date
- The most recent sync time and date
- Sync history
- Linked data where possible
- Metadata that will help identify connections i.e. currency of a connected bank account

## Allow users to delete their connections

Ensure it is obvious how to do delete a connection and revoke access to connected data via your app’s UI.

## Include an option to refresh data

Allow your customers to sync new data when it is suitable for your use case.

## ⭐ Show when the data is actively syncing

Add animation to indicate when data is syncing, e.g. a loading spinner.
