## Why you are here

Your financial services provider has requested access to your NetSuite account and its data. They need to view, create or modify your business's financial data so that they can deliver their services to you. They use Codat to establish the connection to your NetSuite account and asked you to follow our NetSuite connection flow.

:::info What is Codat?
