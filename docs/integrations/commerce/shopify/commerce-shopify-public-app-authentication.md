When a merchant adds your app to their store we need to be able to identify who this is on your end.

During the auth flow, we will redirect the user to the **App Redirect URL** endpoint entered in the [integration settings](/integrations/commerce/shopify/commerce-shopify-setup#add-your-apps-credentials-to-the-shopify-integration). This page should allow the user to authenticate themselves with you and then create (or use an existing) Codat company & data connection that can be returned to us to complete the link flow.

## Technical Details

The initial redirect will include a `code` query string parameter. This is generated by us to maintain context. Upon authenticating the merchant, you will need to either use an existing company/data connection or create a new one. The data connection response will contain a `linkURL` that you can then append the `code` to the query string and redirect the user.
