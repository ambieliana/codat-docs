## Overview

The Bill Pay Kit is a standarized and synchronous API-based solution designed to effortlessly integrate bill pay capabilities into your SMB accounting platforms.

A key difference between the kit and the Sync for Payables offering is its synchronous functionality, a crucial distinction that ensures real-time synchronization between your platform and your SMBs' accounting systems. In today's fast-paced industry landscape, this feature enables our clients to meet the ever-evolving demands of users by delivering a seamless, near-real-time experience.

For instance, with our kit, the creation of a bill in your platform seamlessly aligns with the bill in the SMBs' accounting platform, enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The kit is designed to help neobanks and B2B payment providers in this space, provide an MVP integrated flow to their SMBs as quickly as possible. We have streamlined and built-in logic to our kits endpoints to reduce the complexities of designing, building an maintiain accounting integrations from scratch. It's ideal for facilitating essential bill payment processes within your SMB accounting platforms, focusing on simplicity and efficiency rather than complex procurement functionalities and use cases.

## Prerequisites

When implementing your Sync for Payables solution, you need to create your SMB customer as a [company](../terms/company) in Codat before registering their accounting platform as a connection. You can do that when the customer starts interacting with your application.  

1. Create a company 

Within Sync for Payables, a company represents your SMB customer that pays and manages their bills using your application. To create it, use our [Create company](/sync-for-payables-v2-api#/operations/create-company) endpoint. It returns the company schema containing the ID that you will use to establish a connection to an accounting platform.

2. Create a connection

Next, use the [Create connection](/sync-for-payables-v2-api#/operations/create-connection) endpoint to connect the company to an accounting data source via one of our integrations. This will allow you to synchronize data with that source, fetching or creating suppliers, bills, and payment methods. 

For a more in-depth dive into creating companies and connections, see how to [Configure customer in Codat](/payables/configure-customer), or read more about the concepts of a [company](/core-concepts/companies) and a [connection](/core-concepts/connections).
