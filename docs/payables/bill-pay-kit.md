## Overview

What's the purpose of this kit? what is the difference from the main Payables product? what does it simplify, why do we want to use it instead of the main one

- Synchronous

:::tip Client libraries

Use our comprehensive [libraries](/get-started/libraries) in multiple languages to kick-start and simplify your build.

## Prerequisites

When implementing your Sync for Payables solution, you need to create your SMB customer as a [company](../terms/company) in Codat before registering their accounting platform as a connection. You can do that when the customer starts interacting with your application.  


1. Create a company 

Within Sync for Payables, a company represents your SMB customer that pays and manages their bills using your application. To create it, use our [Create company](/sync-for-payables-v2-api#/operations/create-company) endpoint. It returns the company schema containing the ID that you will use to establish a connection to an accounting platform.

2. Create a connection

Next, use the [Create connection](/sync-for-payables-v2-api#/operations/create-connection) endpoint to connect the company to an accounting data source via one of our integrations. This will allow you to synchronize data with that source, fetching or creating suppliers, bills, and payment methods. 

For a more in-depth dive into creating companies and connections, see how to [Configure customer in Codat](/payables/configure-customer), or read more about the concepts of a [company](/core-concepts/companies) and a [connection](/core-concepts/connections).

## Master data

[List suppliers](/sync-for-payables-v2-api#/operations/list-suppliers) returns a ist of active suppliers, but you can [query](/using-the-api/querying) it to view those with unpaid bills only, or those that were recently created.

I want to be able search for a supplier which is associated with a draft or open bill, to make sure that the supplier details from the accounting platform are up to date
