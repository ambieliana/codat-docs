## What is it?

Grow commercial card volume with
comprehensive and up-to-date supplier
and spend data

Grow commercial card volume in B2B payments

Codat’s Supplier Enablement product removes obstacles to
commercial card volume growth through secure, ongoing, and
consented access to client data in an actionable format.

Codat enhances card programs with seamless data sharing and actionable supplier analytics.

Banks offer business customers a range of corporate cards (both physical & virtual). 

Corporate cards are a key revenue generator for banks. They make money from an interchange fee that is applied to every dollar spent. Encouraging card participation is therefore very important.

Today, relationship managers (RMs) at banks ask prospective card customers to submit a list of key suppliers (& associated payments) as part of the sales process. 

This list is used by the bank to: a) put together a tailored rebate program, which encourages businesses to sign up & use the card; & b) target supplier enablement efforts (i.e. onboard suppliers to be able to accept their card), which increases the amount of spend a participating business is able to put on card.

 overall process of getting suppliers to accept virtual card payments on their invoices

Issuing banks use Codat to access comprehensive and up-to-date data for supplier enablement. Business clients share vendor and spend data directly from their ERP system or accounting software.

## How does it work?

Components

Supplier Enablement API † (Relationship Portal feature)

Spend Analysis feature)

Spend Analysis Report (Spreadsheet)


† Supplier Enablement API has been designed to be consumed directly (i.e. calling the API to refresh data as-needed). It is not recommended to implement via an intermediary store (e.g. dumping data into a data lake and calling from there). Benefiting from API updates & dynamic data refreshes requires consuming Supplier Enablement API directly. 


Easy and Secure Authentication Journey
Let clients share their suppliers and spend data directly and securely from their ERP or accounting system in a few minutes

Consistent and Comprehensive Supplier and Spend Files
Access a comprehensive view of all supplier and spend activity, including individual transactions, payment methods, terms, bill status and more

Monitoring and Data Refresh
Ensure ongoing service excellence for clients by keeping records up-to-date with persistent connections that help spot new eligible spend as well as reversion to check or ACH.

How does it work?

With Sync for Expenses, you can build a solution that covers all the key steps of expense management.

### [Configure customer](/expenses/configure-customer)

Start by creating a [company](../terms/company) to represent your SMB customer in Codat. Then, establish its [connection](/core-concepts/connections) to the customer's accounting platform. We will handle the authorization and linking to that platform - all we need is for your SMB to approve this access via our [auth flow](/auth-flow/overview).

### [Map customer expenses](/expenses/config-and-categorize)

Create expense configuration for your customer's company so that Sync for Expenses can attribute their spend to the correct accounts, suppliers, and customers. 

Expenses can also be categorized according to your SMB's bookkeeping. Provide your customer with the opportunity to choose the accounts, tracking categories, and tax rates that their expenses will be mapped to. 

### [Create and update expenses](/expenses/sync-process/expense-transactions)

Once the customer has categorized their expenses using the mapping options, use Sync for Expenses to push their everyday purchases to the SMB's accounting platform. Sync for Expenses also enables SMB customers to push attachments for a complete audit trail.

### [Sync expense transactions](/expenses/sync-process/syncing-expenses)

Once you create a categorized expense transaction, you can initiate a sync of a set of these transactions. The sync processes the expenses you created, maps them into the format required by the accounting platform, and records them in that platform. 

### [Upload attachments](/expenses/sync-process/uploading-receipts)

When creating an expense transaction, allow your SMB customer to save a copy of the associated receipt in their accounting platform.
