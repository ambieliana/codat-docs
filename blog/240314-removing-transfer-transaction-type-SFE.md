On June 19,2024 we will be removing the Transfer In and Transfer Out transaction type from the Sync for Expenses expense-transaction endpoint. 

To represent a transfer for our expenses offering going forward you will need to use the [transfer-transaction endpoint](link). This endpoint will allow you to represent multi currency transfer, as well as single currency. You can read more information on multicurrency transfers [here](https://docs.codat.io/expenses/fx-management#transfers).
