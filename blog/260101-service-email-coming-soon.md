We are launching service emails to inform your customers that they have:

 - successfully authorized their data connection. We will inform your customer that you can access their data and give them a way for them to control the status of their connection.
 - the data connection has been unlinked. We will inform your customer that can no longer access their data and give them a way to reconnect the connection.

If you opt in (via the google form below), an email will look like this:

#### Link success

#### Connection unlinked 
![Disconnected Service Email](/img/updates/20240716-email-disconnect.png)

- Service emails increase customer engagement and offer them a way to reconnect their account, ensuring connection longevity/resiliency.
