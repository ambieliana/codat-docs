We are launching service emails to inform your customers about the state of their data connection on your behalf. You can opt in early to benefit from this functionality.

<!--truncate-->

Service emails increase customer engagement and offer them a way to reconnect their account, ensuring your connection to their data is resilient.

## What's new?

If you choose to enable this feature, we will contact your customers on your behalf in these scenarios:

 - **Your customer successfully authorized their data connection.**

   We will reassure your customer that they have successfully connected their data with you and give them a way to manage the status of their connection.
  
 - **Your customer's data connection has been unlinked.**

   We will inform your customer that you can no longer access their data and give them a way to reauthorize the connection.

Example emails your customers will receive are presented below:

#### Connection successfully linked

All Codat clients can opt in and start using the customer service email functionality early.
