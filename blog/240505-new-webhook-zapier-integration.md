We're excited to announce the pre-release of our new webhook Zapier integration, making it easier for you to build automated workflows from our webhook event types.

<!--truncate-->

Things to say:

- What is the service
- Where to go to learn how to use it
- An image
- Why is it in pre-release: We are currently going through Zapier's approval process. For us to start this we need to have at least 3 beta users to using our integration. Would be good to reach out to some clients for this. Read the doc and it shows you how to get access to the private integration.
