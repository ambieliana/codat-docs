### What's new?

We are excited to announce enhancements to our webhook event catalog, featuring the introduction of deprecation flags for specific properties.

#### Key benefits

- **Clear identification**: Easily spot deprecated properties.
- **Up-to-date integrations**: Ensure your builds use the most current and supported properties.

This addition is designed to help you easily identify which properties are deprecated and should no longer be used when building to a webhook event type.
