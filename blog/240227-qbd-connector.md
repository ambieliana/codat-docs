Weâ€™ve released a new QuickBooks Desktop connector that provides an improved user journey and best-in-class linking experience. 

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

With this release, we have: 

- Migrated to our next-generation architecture, which provides more resilient data acquisition. 
- Simplified the linking journey for your small business customers.
- Streamlined the connectivity to hosted QuickBooks environments. This means that Rightworks (formerly Right Networks) and QuickBooks Enterprise Cloud no longer require connector installation, certification or minimum client commitment. 

You can read more about the changes in our [QuickBooks Desktop (on-premise) documentation](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/accounting-quickbooksdesktop).

## Who is this relevant for? 

As an existing client, this update does not impact your current QuickBooks Desktop connected companies, and you do not need to make any changes. You can continue to use your current version of the QuickBooks Desktop connector, and the integration continues to be supported for all existing clients. 

The new QuickBooks Desktop connector will be automatically enabled for all new Codat clients.

## How to get started? 

All new connections for QuickBooks Desktop for new Codat clients will automatically follow the updated Link flow, which utilizes the new connector. If you are an existing client and would like to migrate to the new connector, this will require: 

- Testing, supported by Codat and available alongside the existing connector.
- Existing connected companies will need to re-authenticate. 

If you'd like to get started, or to find out more about the new connector, contact your Codat Account Manager.
